# email_tracker
email_tracker is a program to track when emails have been opened and/or forwarded.
It works by adding a very small image to an email, that is hosted on a server. 
When the image is loaded, the server looks up the images unique identifier and links it to a recipient. 
This program will then notify the user of that email being opened.
